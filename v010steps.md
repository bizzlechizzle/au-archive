## App Improvements / Bug Fixes

### Import Pop-up (Replaces Imports Page)

**[ ] Remove dedicated /imports page** - replaced by global pop-up

#### Mandatory Fields

**Location Name**
- Used for folders, needed to generate short name
- [ ] Update label from "Location Name" to "Name"

**Type**
- Used for folders, needed for state-type folder structure

**State**
- Used for folders, needed for state-type folder structure

#### State/Type Field Dependencies
